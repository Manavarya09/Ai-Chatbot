# Simple AI Chatbot

This is a basic AI chatbot built in Python. It identifies user intents like greetings, goodbyes, and thanks, and responds accordingly.

## Features
- Text-based chatbot
- Simple intent recognition using token matching
- Randomized responses for each intent

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the chatbot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Future Improvements
- Use a trained NLP model for better intent classification
- Add a GUI using Tkinter or a web interface using Flask
- Implement memory for more natural conversations
